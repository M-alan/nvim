# Neovim Configuration files

This exists to make configuring neovim on my devices easier.

> Install neovim: choco install neovim

> If on windows make a file called nvim directory should look like this: C:\Users\userName\AppData\Local\nvim
> inside that nvim file is where all the other files and folders go 

> install vim-plug using curl: curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
> The command and the url are all one thing

> **DONT FORGET TO SOURCE ALL YOUR FILES\FOLDERS IN THE init.vim file**
> ** ALSO DONT FORGET THAT WHEN YOU OPEN NVIM TYPE *:PlugInstall* to install all the plugins you had in your plugins.vim(inside vim-plug) **

## Things to know after all of the above
> Dont forget to change some file locations in init.vim, pluggins.vim
> key Bindings are in the key folders
> general settings like set numbers are in teh general folder
